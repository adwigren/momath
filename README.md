# MoMath Hackathon 2017: Fibonacci Cookie Hunt!

- Math Square behavior
- Adam Wigren, Lisa Li

## The Math

Our project utilizes the Fibonacci sequence of integers as radii for circular areas.

## The Submission

Our submission allows users to hunt for cookies on the Math Square touchscreen, with every cookie eaten represented in a cookie tail that follows the user around as they walk. The consumed cookies are represented as a sequence of Fibonacci numbers for circular areas through the growing cookie trail. As the user eats more cookies, they can see how it affects the length of their cookie trail, including how many cookies it takes to lengthen it. We envision the target audience for our submission to be kids who enjoy running around chasing after items on the floor and having a trail behind them.


## Additional Notes

Code is represented in the following files:
- cookie_grow.js
- images/cookie.png
- models/CookieTable.js
- models/CookieMonster.js
- components/CookieMonsterComponent.js
- components/CookieTableComponent.js

Along with this completed readme, this repository should contain **the single file** or files needed for your submission. For example, if this submission is a _Math Square_ behavior, only submit the JavaScript or TypeScript file containing the behavior, not the entire source of the exhibit.
